title: "BackgroundAppUpdate"
description: "Enable or disable automatic application update in the background, when the application is not running."
---

Enable or disable **automatic** application update **in the background**, when the application is not running.

If set to true, application updates may be installed (without user approval) in the background, even when the application is not running. The operating system might still require approval.

If set to false, the application will not try to install updates when the application is not running.

If you have disabled updates via `DisableAppUpdate` or disabled automatic updates via `AppAutoUpdate`, this policy has no effect.

If you are having trouble getting the background task to run, verify your configuration with the ["Requirements to run" section in this support document](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-background-updates-firefox-windows).

**Compatibility:** Firefox 90 (Windows only)\
**CCK2 Equivalent:** N/A\
**Preferences Affected:** `app.update.background.enabled`
