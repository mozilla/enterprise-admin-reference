There are two policies that allow for sanitizing (clearing) local data on shutdown in Firefox.
You may clear all data, or choose from one or more of Browsing & Download History, Cookies, Active Logins, Cache, Form History, Site Preferences, and Offline Website Data:

- **[SanitizeOnShutdown (All)](/reference/policies/sanitizeonshutdown-all/):** Clear all local data on shutdown.
- **[SanitizeOnShutdown (Selective)](/reference/policies/sanitizeonshutdown-selective/):** Clear specific types of data on shutdown.
